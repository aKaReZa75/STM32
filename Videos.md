# Videos
In this document, you will find brief descriptions for each video.  
These summaries provide an overview of the topics covered in each video, allowing you to quickly and easily understand the content presented.  
The purpose of these short descriptions is to give a clear and concise understanding of each video's subject matter.

> [!IMPORTANT]
In this section, only **STM32**-related videos are available. These videos are generally divided into two main categories:
>
> 1. **General Concepts and Basics:**  
   This part includes videos that provide foundational knowledge and general principles of microcontrollers. Videos in this category typically begin with the word *`Microcontroller`*.
>      - **Example:** In the video "*aKaReZa 45 - Microcontroller, Interrupts*", the overall functionality and applications of interrupts across different types of microcontrollers are explained. This helps build a solid understanding of the interrupt mechanism before diving into specific implementations.  
>    
> 2. **Microcontroller-Specific Implementations:**  
    "This part focuses on detailed setups, configurations, and practical demonstrations tailored to a specific microcontroller.  
    Videos in this category are identified by keywords related to specific microcontroller families such as *`AVR`*, *`STM32`*, *`STM8`*, *`ESP8266`*, *`ESP32`*, and *`PIC`*.
>      - **Example for STM32:** In the video "*aKaReZa 101 - STM32, Introduction - PART A*", you'll get a clear and structured introduction to **STM32 microcontrollers**. It explains the **STM32 naming convention**, **ARM Cortex-M architecture**, and key models like the `STM32F103C8T6`. The video also compares **different programmers**, explores **bootloader techniques**, and introduces tools used in STM32 development. It’s a perfect starting point for anyone looking to enter the world of STM32 programming.

> [!NOTE]
> 1. It is strongly advised to first watch the general concept videos (identified by the keyword *`Microcontroller`*) to build a solid theoretical foundation. 
> 2. Once you have a good understanding, proceed to the microcontroller-specific videos (identified by their respective keywords such as *`AVR`*, *`STM32`*, etc.) to see how these concepts are applied in practice.  

> [!TIP]  
> - The prerequisites for each video are clearly mentioned at the beginning of the respective video.
